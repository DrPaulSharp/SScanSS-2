SScanSS-2
=================
SScanSS 2 (pronounced “*scans two*”) provides a virtual laboratory for planning, visualising, and setting-up strain scanning experiments on engineering beam-line instruments.  
SScanSS 2 which is an acronym for **S**train **Scan**ning **S**imulation **S**oftware uses a computer model of the instrument i.e. jaws, collimators, positioning system and 3D model of the sample to simulate the measurement procedure. The main output of the simulation is a script that can be used to drive the real-world positioning system to the desired measurement positions.
