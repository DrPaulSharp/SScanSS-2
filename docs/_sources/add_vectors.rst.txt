In the graphics window, a measurement vector will be rendered as a line originating from the associated measurement
point, with a colour that indicates the detector measuring the vector.

* Select the measurement point to apply strain component to.
* Select the detector that will measure the strain component.
* Select strain component direction.
* Click the Reverse direction checkbox to negate the vector if necessary.
* Click **Add Measurement Vector** button.

Setting up multiple alignments
==============================
It may be advantageous to measure more than one component at a measurement point before moving on to the next measurement point.
For example, using the ENGINX goniometer it is possible set up multiple alignments such that all three strain components are
measured at each point before moving on to the next point. This option is only suitable for positioning systems with
sufficient degrees of freedom. To add a new alignment:

* Click the "Add new..." option in the alignment drop-down box.
* Follow the set to add stain components for the new alignment.

**************************
Manage measurement vectors
**************************
Measurement vectors can be viewed and managed via the vector manager. The vector manager will be opened when measurement
vectors are added, if the vector manager is closed it can be opened by selecting **View > Other Windows > Measurement Vectors**
in the menu.

When more than one alignment is present, the vector manager can be used to remove alignment. Select
alignment from the drop-down and click the delete button.

.. tip::
    The software will only render one alignment at a time. To view a different alignment, select the alignment
    from the vector manager.
